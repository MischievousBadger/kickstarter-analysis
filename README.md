# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is a playwright who would like to plan a Kickstarter campaign to fund her play, Fever.  She would like to know how her estimated $10,000 goal for the campaign compares with other Kickstarters for similar theater projects.  
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze crowdfunding data for Louise, to identify factors from successful campaigns that she can capitalize upon and utilize to reach her goals.  

## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis was performed by filtering the data to the required specifications based on Louise’s needs, creating new columns, tables and pivot tables as appropriate, along with the creation of charts for better visualization of the pivot table data.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Analysis of Theater Outcomes by Launch Data reveals theater campaigns are most successful in the month of May with 111 successful campaigns, with June and July having the second and third most successful outcomes with 100 and 87, respectively. It is also noted that there were more successful theater campaigns recorded than failed or canceled, with 839 successful out of 1369 total campaigns, compared with 493 failed and 37 canceled.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals reveals that the largest number of successful plays (387) fell in the goal funding range of $1000 to $4999, while few plays with goals above $10,000 were successful. This would indicate that Louise's goal of $10,000+ may need to be reconsidered, for best chances of fully funding her goal.  It was also noted on the graph that there appeared to be a few outliers (successful plays) at high funding levels, which should be further explored to determine if they are data errors and can be removed from teh dataset.   
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No challenges were personally noted while completing this project or analyzing the data. One possible challenge that could be encountered is errors created from incorrect filtering of the Theater Outcomes pivot table, which some classmates experienced.  One difficulty encountered personally was the desire to add more tables to further analyze the data, as while the current tables and graphs create an adequate picture of the specific theater and play data for Louise, a broader look at all Kickstarter campaigns for outcomes by launch date might also be useful to see if those trends carry outside of the one narrow category.  

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion that can be drawn from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is that Kickstarter campaigns launched in late spring through early summer are more successful than campaigns launched in the fall and winter months, with the months of May through July having the greatest number of successful campaigns by month.  Another conclusion that can be drawn from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is that failed campaigns (except for the month of October) follow a steady pattern throughout the year without significant rises or falls.  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
From the Outcomes based on Goals, one can conclude that the bulk of the successful Kickstarter campaigns received less than $15,000 in funding.   Additionally, there were no canceled plays campaigns noted when analyzing the Outcomes Based on Goals. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation of the dataset is that we primarily analyzed only a very narrow portion of the data that was most pertinent to Louise’s campaign, but important information regarding outcomes and launch dates could have possibly been gleaned from analyzing all campaigns.  In this instance, analyzing a wider portion of the data and comparing categories and subcategories more thoroughly may have provided helpful information for Louise. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a table with the percentages of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns by month. 
We could create a table that also compares month with the funding goal and percent successful/failed/canceled.  
We could create tables and graphs for Outcomes by Launch Date and Outcomes based on Goals, utilizing all available Kickstarters, instead of drilling down to theater and plays campaigns.
